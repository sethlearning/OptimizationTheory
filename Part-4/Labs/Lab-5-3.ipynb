Вам необязательно строить самую лучшую модель и получать лучшее качество на тестовых данных. Самое важное – это научиться обучать модели и анализировать полученные результаты. В результате, вы научитесь использовать и подготавливать данные для решения задачи классификации. Так же вы изучите на практике различные алгоритмы машиного обучения, такие как логистическая регрессия, полносвязные нейронные сети и сверточные нейронные сети. Более того, вы научитесь обучать эти модели и анализировать результаты работы этих алгоритмов на новых данных\n","\n","Fashion-MNIST – это датасет состоящий из 70000 черно-белых изображений одежды 28х28 пикселей каждое. 60000 из них содержатся в тренировочной выборке, и 10000 – в тестовой. Этот набор данных представляет из себя альтернативу обычному датасету рукописных цифр MNIST.

Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.\n","\n","To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27.
